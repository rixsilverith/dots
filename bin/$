#!/usr/bin/bash

# Useful when copying and pasting command from the internet

# A "$" is usually put at the beginning of a comamnd to indicate
# that it must be executed on the command line. When copy-pasting
# terminal commands from the internet usually you'll end up
# copying the dollar sign too, leading to something like "command
# not found" when trying to run the command. This file solves
# this problem by registering "$" as a valid command which runs
# everything after the dollar sign as usual.
